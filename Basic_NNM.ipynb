        "  # Number of Parameters: The number of neurons in a layer directly influences the number of weights and biases (parameters) in the connections between that layer and the next. More neurons mean more parameters. A model with too many parameters relative to the amount of training data can lead to overfitting (performing well on training data but poorly on unseen data).\n",
        "  # Computational Cost: More neurons mean more calculations are performed during the forward and backward passes, increasing the training and inference time.\n",
        "  # Learning Ability: The right number of neurons in the hidden layers allows the model to capture the underlying structure of the data effectively. Too few neurons might prevent the model from learning complex relationships (underfitting), while too many can lead to overfitting.\n",
        "  # How to choose them: Choosing the optimal number of neurons in hidden layers (h1, h2, etc.) is a crucial part of designing a neural network architecture. There's no single formula for this; it often involves:\n",
        "  # Experimentation: Trying different numbers of neurons and evaluating the model's performance on a validation set.\n",
        "  # Heuristics: Starting with values between the input and output layer sizes, or using powers of 2 (e.g., 16, 32, 64).\n",
